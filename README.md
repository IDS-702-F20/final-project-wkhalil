## Final-Project
### Project Title
#### Factors Affecting the Income




### Background
In the United States, there are common differences in income. There are many factors that affect income, such as age, education level, gender, race, region, etc. The question naturally arises: What are the most influential factors in the income of American adults? What is the influence of factors on income? I'd like to study it more closely by investigating the 1994 income and corresponding social factor data. 

### Questions
What are the factors that affect whether the income exceeds $50K?
What are the factors that have the greatest impact on whether income exceeds $50K?
For a person who wants to increase their income, what are the recommendations that can be implemented? (What social factors can be changed to increase the probability of high income)


### Data
The Us Adult income dataset was extracted by Barry Becker from the 1994 US Census Database. The data set consists of anonymous information such as occupation, age, native country, race, capital gain, capital loss, education, work class and more. Each row is labelled as either having a salary greater than ">50K" or "<=50K". This Data set is split into two CSV files, named adult-training.txt and adult-test.txt.

Note that the dataset is made up of categorical and continuous features. It also contains missing values. The categorical variables are:  ‘type_employer’, ‘education’, ‘marital’, ‘occupation’, ‘relationship’, ‘race’, ‘sex’, ‘country’. The continuous variables are: ‘age’, ‘fnlwgt’, ‘education_num’, ‘capital_gain’, ‘capital_loss’, ‘hr_per_week’.
This Dataset was obtained from the UCI machine learning database, it can be found on

### Project Plan
I will first spend a week to observe and process the data, then a week to build the model, and finally a week to extract the major findings and form the report.
